# snusergen
A snupid snogram to generate snusernames following the snail meme format.

Your friends will be guaranteed (citation needed, terms and conditions apply) to be all like "Wow, you have a username? Those haven't been cool since November 1st, 2024! As soon as snusergen came out, I switched right over and now I'm like all 🐌😎. Susergen is the future! I mean, the whole 'make a snail version of a thing by replacing the first letter with sn' thing hasn't been cool since like 2015, so it's very retro and hip!"

I mean, who could turn down an offer (a snoffer???) like that!
